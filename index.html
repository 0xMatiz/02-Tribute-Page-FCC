    <p id="tribute-info">I, Escanor, am a powerful character who stars in the anime "The Seven Deadly Sins". I am known as "The Lion of Pride," and my strength gradually rises as the sun illuminates my path. My overwhelming power and arrogant attitude have earned me admiration and respect.

      During the day, I transform into an imposing figure capable of easily defeating my enemies. My presence exudes confidence and mastery, leaving a lasting impression on those who cross my path. However, during the night, my power diminishes, and I become vulnerable, reminding me that even the mightiest have their moments of weakness.
      
      Despite this duality, my legacy endures in the hearts of viewers. I am one of the most popular and beloved characters in the series, leaving an indelible mark on those who witness my greatness.</p>
